# RubiK-s-Cube

Implemented a Rubik’s Cube solver using Korf’s IDA* search algorithm, achieving efficient solutions for scrambled states with optimized search depth and performance.

## Project Overview
Built a Rubik’s Cube (3x3) solver in C++ using advanced search algorithms, including Korf’s IDA*, BFS, DFS, and IDDFS, with object-oriented design for effective cube modeling and solving.

## Features / CV Points
• Engineered efficient solving algorithms including Korf’s IDA*, consistently achieving solving times under 3 seconds for standard jumbles  
• Applied multiple strategies (BFS, DFS, IDDFS) with object-oriented design to effectively model and solve virtual cube structures  
• Implemented Korf’s IDA* to achieve reliable solving times under 10 seconds for cubes scrambled up to 13 times, ensuring scalability  
• Enhanced computational efficiency by refining node expansion logic and eliminating redundant search paths during execution
